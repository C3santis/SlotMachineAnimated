# SlotMachineAnimated
My first Java project. Application SlotMachine for Android. Initially, the user has 1000 coins. 
With the buttons "+" or "-" he can change the bet. The "Reset" button drops the amount of coins to 10. 
The "Spin" button starts the SlotMachine. If 2 slots match the line - the bet becomes x2, if 3 - bet x4, if 4 - bet x6, if 5 - bet x10. 
If line hasn't match bet x(-1). Coins are saved, when exiting the application. 
If the bet is more than the alleged losing, start the SlotMachine will not work.
